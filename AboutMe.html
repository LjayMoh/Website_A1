                    I am a very humble, kind, loving, caring, creative, supportive, God-fearing, faithful, smart, and patient being,
                    I always try to find the good in every person I connect with, and give the opportunity to be in my circle.
                    I believe that we all deserve many chances in life to prove to ourselves and others that we can be better and do better.
                    Waking up everyday is a lucky chance for all of us to be better humans than we were yesterday.
                 </p>

                     I was born and raised in the Vaal and completed my matric back in 2018, I then took a gap year to upgrade my marks in 2019, I chose to go upgrade my Physical Science 
                     and Mathematics marks. I applied for different courses at different universities, then accepted the offer to go study at <em>University of the Witwatersrand</em> in Johannesburg.
                     I got accepted to join the <em>Wits School of Arts in Digital Arts</em>  which really got me excited because I love art wholeheartedly. At first, I had no idea what was expected of me in the 
                     Digital Arts course, but I grew to understand and engage more with it.
                 </p>
         
                 <p>
                     I did not get the chance to enjoy my first year in the university and get my mind at ease that I am not a high school kid anymore. The past two years were not easy since we 
                     had no choice but to move to online learning. I did not think I was going to be able to manage because I had to go study at home and there were so many distractions and challenges.
                     Gratefully, I passed all my modules, even though they were not the marks I was hoping for, I am thankful that I did not have to repeat any of them.
                 </p>
         
                 <p>
                     Now I am a third year <em>Digital Arts</em> student in the <em>Wits School of Arts</em>. I chose to major in Interactive Media and Animation, I have no regrets for the choice I made as I am enjoying the two modules
                     so far, even though I feel like there is going to be a lot of work as time goes, I am ready to do the best I can. As they say, when you do not apply pressure, you will feel it!
