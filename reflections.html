                    The first step I took before designing this website was to sketch out the wireframes.
                    The wireframes helped to give me start-up ideas of how I wanted the webpages to look like. I thought about the structure of my website and what 
                    information I should put in different pages following the rubric for this assignment. Then I decided to make sections that were going to hold the information in each blog post.
                    My initial goal was to keep everything simple and easy to understand. This was going to include the font, color, layout, and content.

                    From the sketched wireframes I began to design the webpages, beginning with the homepage, then I took it from there to design other pages, these are,
                    profile page, portfolio page, blog posts pages, and the pages for the design of the site. The homepage includes in it two sections namely Blog Posts section and Site Design section.
                    The Blog posts section has three links pages in it which are for the reflections of the readings we engaged with the second, fourth, and sixth weeks of the first quater; then the site design section 
                    includes three links for pages which are for the wireframes illustrations, style guides for the site, and creative reflections on the development of the website. Then on the homepage I also included 
                    two links that lead the viewer to the profile and the porfolio pages. I wanted to make the viewer have an idea about the content of the website at first glance, that is the reason I decide to have a background image of a 
                    joystick, keyboard, mouse, and headphones to illustrate the digital world.

                    For each page I wanted to keep the content clear and understandable and use colors that are color-blind-friendly. I decided to use different images that would complement the content in each page and make the viewer
                    understand that idea behind the design. I used a lot of white for the texts because I wanted to give clarity, and simplicity to the information and do not end up boring the reader. The process of designng this website was
                    not that hard as it was easy to understand the languages that are required to build the websites. The lecture videos that gave and showed the fundamentals of the CSS, JavaScript, and HTML languages were very helpful for the 
                    development of the website, since I got the chance to refer back to them when I was not sure of what I was doing. I took about a week to design the website and think of ideas that would make it better and presentable.
