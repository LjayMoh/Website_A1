                        According to McLuhan things that do not spell out names or verbal ads are considered pure information;
                        he goes on to make an example of electric light. The electric light has no “content”, so it is not seen as a communication medium;
                        the information of any medium is always another medium. What people do with the machine gives its meaning; 
                        the way it is used is what determines its value. The arrangement of human association is shaped and controlled by the medium.

                        This reading made me think about how a lot of things are communicated and expressed differently depending on what the medium is 
                        and how it is used. How we think, feel, and interact is now influenced by how we see technology and use it in our daily lives. 
                        Human affairs are controlled and affected by the message every technology that is developed brings. 
                        The medium has the power to bring about change and growth into this world, it has control over the roles people play in everyday life.
                        Every medium has its own meaning, it is all about how people interpret it or use it and thus affecting human relationships.
                        From my point of view, McLuhan gives us an insight into how the growth of mediums or technology affects the way we as people think and interact with one another. 
                        It is how we interact with the evolving technology that gives and shows its message. I found this reading really interesting
                        because we live in a world where we try to find meaning in everything we do
                        or everything we interact with. How we use the medium as technology evolves has its own social and personal consequences.

                        McLuhan makes us understand what our interaction with the medium brings, and how we end up making sense of the technology we use.
                        He gives a coherent emphasis on how meaning is brought about by the medium and how other things cannot be interpreted as a communication medium that brings content.
