                <h1>Colour</h1>
                <p>
                    I did not use too many colours to design this website because I wanted to keep everything simple and easy to look at. I used black, 
                    white, red-purple, and deep-red. Most of these colors I used on different texts, for the blog post I used the white for the text that
                    gives the content, this is because white signifies simplicity an clarity. For the profile page I used black for the text so that it can 
                    signify to the viewer the power and elegance of my personal information. I used the red-purple to singinfy some creativity, and expression 
                    for the work I did. Then lastly, used the deep-red to signify the refinement of the information I am giving to the viewer.
                </p>
    
                <h1>Font</h1>
                <p>
                    I chose to use Times New Roman from the font-family for the texts in all the pages,this is because most people are familiar with it,
                    and it is used in many texts, also because it is easy to read and suitable for reading plain text. I used different
                    font-sizes to best suit the layout and to show which text is the heading or gives more important information.
                </p>
    
                <h1>Layout</h1>
                <p>
                    For the layout of this website I decided to keep everything simple and make the visuals to be eye-catchy, hence I used images for the 
                    background of each page to complement the content that the page holds, I did my best to keep the text simple and use appropriate words.
                    My aim was to ensure a smooth flow of the work with order and making the viewer understand the information on each page without any confusion.
